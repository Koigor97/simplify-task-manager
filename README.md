# SimplifyBiz Task Manager
A custom WordPress plugin built for the Simplify internship. This project serves as a learning tool and a practical way  
to manage internship tasks and experiments directly within the WordPress admin dashboard.

> It's meant to be used by future SimplifyBiz interns to help them keep track of tasks  
> and complete business objectives.

## Core Features (Roadmap)
This plugin is being built incrementally. The planned features include:
- **Custom Login Screen:** Replaces the default WordPress login page with a custom-branded "Simplify" login screen,   
including a new logo, title, and background.
- **Kanban Task Manager:** A simple task board (TODO, In-Progress, In-Review, Done) added as an admin   
menu page to track all internship tasks.
- **Dashboard Stats Widget:** A custom widget for the main dashboard to show a quick overview of task   
statistics (e.g., X Completed, Y In-Progress).
- **Custom Integrations (in the future):** A central place to house all custom code required by internship tasks,   
such as the Gravity Forms webhook integration.
